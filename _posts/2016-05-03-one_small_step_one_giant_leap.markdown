Like many, I’ve been watching from the sidelines.

My journey in graduate school began almost eight months ago. Excited to leave a high-stress, but somewhat meaningful job to study with some of the world’s most revered academics, I thought that I’d be charting a course that I’d dreamt about for years.

I focused my studies on the economies of protracted conflict. That is, how individuals set up systems of governance to regulate exchange in many of the most dangerous parts of the world; warzones in the Middle East.

Having grown up studying French, learning Hebrew in high school, Arabic in college, and Spanish on my first job assignment abroad, I thought that this would be where I’d thrive. And even more alluring, I could tack an extra year onto the program to graduate with an MBA!

I spent much of my first semester listening, attempting to do all that I could to learn the ropes and absorb as much knowledge as possible from my classmates and professors to best inform my prospective research. Somehow, I found myself appointed as senator to represent the graduate student body on the university’s senate, serve as a voting delegate and parliamentarian on the college-wide student council, and be courted by university leaders for further involvement.

A couple of months into the program, however, I got sidetracked. A friend had posted a link on Facebook to a new online web development program that was created by one of the most reputable coding schools in the industry, The Flatiron School.
I looked at the post with some skepticism, but learned that every prospective applicant needed to first complete a free introductory Ruby course. Considering the years that I’d spent tinkering with CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, and Lynda.com, I decided to give it a go.
And wow, how I loved it!

I found myself staying up until the early hours of the morning completing lessons, lab work, and assessments. I’d catch myself digressing from my research to learn more about the code that I’d envision writing, even pulling all-nighters to get more of the Ruby course done – and then skipping off to join my classmates at NYU.

Finally, the interview. I spoke with one of the co-founders, Adam Enbar, who shared his vision with me, and I shared mine. Already hesitant about staying enrolled in the graduate program – I wasn’t loving it as planned, but that’s another story – I decided to give coding a shot.

After treating tech like a spectator sport for decades, I decided that it was my turn to throw a hat into the ring. And so, having taken the first step, here’s my giant leap!
